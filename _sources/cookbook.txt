Cookbook
========
The current policy of MoviePy is that most advanced features should not
be included in the core program, but should rather be provided by
individual coders as code snippets, by means of blogs, gits, etc.
Then one can make a customized ``moviepytools.py`` module containing
the advanced methods that one uses most.

In this cookbook you will find a few scripts for useful tasks
such as tracking an object, generating end credits, etc...
For more artistic and less general functionalities, see the :ref:`examples` .
