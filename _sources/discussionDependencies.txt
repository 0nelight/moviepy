Discussion of the dependencies
===============================

I have found that complicated dependencies are a main reason why people get
discouraged by a software, so all advices are welcome !


Movie writing
--------------

For now ffmpeg is used to generate movies (instead of OpenCV's movie
writers) because I like how you can tune the quality of the movie with
ffmpeg.
  
Movie Rendering
----------------

I am using Pygame instead of the original OpenCV frontend because Pygame
can also generate sound (maybe later movie previews will also play the
sound).
  
I know there is a war between ffmpeg/avconv/mencoder. I think ffmpeg
is the most spread software. And no, it's not deprecated.

  
Movie and Image manimulation
-----------------------------

The python package SimpleCV is an attempt at making OpenCV easier to use.
It is totally cool, but the OpenCV devs are also trying to make it easier
so they always make a lot of changes which break SimpleCV. They use
the Python Imaging Library for image processing.

The package Wand (a Python binder for ImageMagick) is nice and is starting
to accept numpy array images input/output.
   

Sound
------

The python package Pydub is really good but working with numpy arrays
gives more freedom so I stick with Scipy.
