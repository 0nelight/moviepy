What is new in MoviePy ?
========================

August 31, 2013
---------------

There is now a *what is new ?* page in the documentation :)

API changes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many import names have changed (while it is still time). ``MovieClip`` becomes ``VideoFileClip``. ``SoundClip`` becomes ``AudioFileClip``. ``concat`` becomes ``ConcatVideoClip``. The method ``to_movie`` becomes ``to_videofile``

Names sould not change so much in the future, but be careful and read the docs !

In ``CompositeVideoClip`` the size is now optional. The default size will be the size of the background image (first image of the clips list).


Under the hood:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


- The sound is now generated on the flight by threading during previews (reduces the latency before the preview launches).

- By default the generation of the sound is now parallelized when writing a video. Depending on how complicated your composition is, the sound may be the limiting factor. It takes more than 1 second to produce 6 seconds of stereo 44100Hz sound, which is 5-10 times slower than simple video writing.

- Sounds are now streamed, they take a moderate place in the memory.

- Audio frames are now represented by floats. It is converted in 8-, 16-, or 32-bit integer format when rendering to a file or previewing. Now all sounds can be mixed together whatever their original framerates and sample width.
