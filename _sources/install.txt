Installation
------------


MoviePy is very light (~1000 lines of code) but it uses many existing
Python libraries:

- `OpenCV 2.4.6`_ to read the movies
- PyGame_ for video/sound previews
- `Scipy and Numpy`_, for image/sound manipulation
- `Scikit Image`_ for advanced image manipulation 
- The Decorator_ module for better code readability

And needs some software:
- ffmpeg_, for writing movies and many useful operations.
- imageMagick_ for text generation (and much more in the future)

All these are normally easy to install (on linux, most of these will be in your repos).

Then you open a console in the moviepy source directory and type

    sudo python setup.py install
