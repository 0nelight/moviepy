Download And Installation
--------------------------

You can `download MoviePy`_ on Github. Just unzip everything in one folder, open a terminal and type ::
    
    sudo python setup.py install


**This should install the python packages listed below, but NOT OpenCV, which you will have to download manually for the moment.**

MoviePy is a very small program but it relies on many existing Python packages:

- `OpenCV 2.4.6`_ or more recent, to read and write movie files. 
- PyGame_ for video and sound previews
- `Scipy and Numpy`_, for image and sound manipulation
- `Scikit Image`_ for advanced image manipulation 
- The Decorator_ module for better code readability



MoviePy also needs some external software:

- ffmpeg_, for writing movies and many other useful operations.
- imageMagick_ for text generation, GIF support, and much more in the future.

All these are normally easy to install (on linux, they will certainly be in your repos).
