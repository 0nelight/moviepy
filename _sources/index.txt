MoviePy
=======

MoviePy is a Python module for script-based movie editing, which enables
basic operations (cuts, concatenations, title insertions) to be done
in a few lines. It can also be used for advanced compositing ; let us
put together several example clips (the software is not responsible
for my bad taste):
::
    import os
    from moviepy import *
    clips = [MovieClip(m) for m in sorted(os.listdir("clips/"))]
    video = concatenate(clips, transition = MovieClip("logo.mp4"))
    video.write('demo.ogv')

You will find the code for each clip in the Cookbook. You can do
pretty much any effect you want with MoviePy, but in most cases you
will need to code a little (or find someone who will !).

MoviePy is an open source software written by Zulko_ and released under
the MIT liscence. Everyone is welcome to help improve the project,
fork it, share new effects, etc...
